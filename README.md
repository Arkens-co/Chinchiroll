# Chinchiroll
Dice game currently out on Android. All the code is done by myself. 
This is intended only to showcase codework and little else.

As such, this repository contains only the scripts that I myself made and nothing else. As it depends on the scenes and assets to function properly (particularly the physics aspects), it will not run on its own.
